Flashcard Tool will be a program to facilitate and accelerate the teaching and learning of materials using computerized flash cards. It will act as an interface where the user can study and practice specific materials at their leisure and own pace. It will be available for use at home or in educational environments. 


The primary goal of this project is to develop a Simple COMP354 Flashcard Tool (SCFT). 

The purpose of this implementation document is to provide all details of the implementation of the Simple COMP354 Flashcard Tool (SCFT). The document will include the tests made, which testing style has been chosen, followed by a real implementation of the game using Java language.

1.  Purpose
The purpose of this document is to present the design of the Simple COMP354 Flashcard Tool (SCFT), which is in partial fulfillment of the requirements of the COMP 354. It will provide details on testing and how the game was implemented. It will follow a white-box and a branch testing of 3 different methods. The document will also talk about which type of unit integration test was performed. Followed by screenshots, the working prototype will be shown. 

2.	Project Scope
This document is intended to provide the details of the actual implementation of the Simple COMP354 Flashcard Tool that will be used as a basis for the implementation phase. The test technique that is used will be explained in great detail in order to give the idea of how the game was implemented. Furthermore, screen shots of the game will provide a basis for the actual graphical user interface used in the game. The white-box and branch tests will follow for 3 different methods. 


3.	  Document Preview
   The intended audiences of stakeholders for this specification of the SCFT include:
	Concordia Staff, who are any teachers or employees who commissioned the product:
Dr. Juergen Rilling, who commissioned this project on behalf of Concordia and must approve it.
		TA`s, who may help evaluate the product.
		Deck Designers, who will create new decks for the product after release.



The remainder of this document is divided into four major parts: 
>> The actual implementation document to tell which libraries used
>> white-box was testing with a branch testing
>> screen captures
>> the major changes between the design document and this final implementation.
